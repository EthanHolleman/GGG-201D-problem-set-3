# Problem 1

## Part A

Generate a scatter plot that shows the properties of selection in large populations. The x-axis should be frequency of the advantageous allele and range from 0 to 1. The y-axis should be the change in frequency of the advantageous allele after one generation of selection. Perform calculations in steps of 0.01 for each of the following six (1a, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b, 2c) scenarios: (1) the homozygous deleterious genotype has a selection coefficient of 0.1 and the advantageous allele is (a) recessive, (b) dominant or (c) additive; (2) the homozygous deleterious genotype has a selection coefficient of 0.25 and the advantageous allele is (a) recessive, (b) dominant or (c) additive.

## Part B

Four of the six plots from above are highly asymmetric. Explain the biological reason behind these asymmetric patterns.

# Problem 2

You sequence a 5.6 kb locus in 5 diploid individuals and observe 11 segregating sites. What is your estimate of theta in this population? What property of the expected coalescent tree is this estimate based on? What is your estimate of coalescent Ne assuming a mutation rate of 10^-8 per bp per generation?

# Problem 3

Explain the difference between coalescent effective population size (Ne) and instantaneous Ne. What isone way to estimate coalescent Ne? What is one way to estimate instantaneous Ne?

# Problem 4

The expected time to the first coalescent event of four gene copies is 2N/6 generations before the present but the actual time could be much more or much less. If you sample 100 sets of four gene copies, each set has an actual time to the first coalescent event. Do you expect the number of sets that have an actual first coalescent before 2N/6 to be approximately equal to the number of sets to have an actual first coalescent after 2N/6? Explain your answer.
